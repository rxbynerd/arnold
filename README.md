## What

Arnold is a feature flag management & distribution system, designed to be used with Determinator.

This will not teach you how to use feature flags, or the powers of feature flags. This system is designed for those who have worked in an environment with strong feature-flagging and experimentation practices, and those that understand the advantages such an approach brings.
